| public       | Indicates that an element is accessible from any other code.                                      |
| private      | Restricts access to an element only within its containing class.                                  |
| protected    | Allows access to an element within its containing class and its subclasses.                       |
| internal     | Provides access to an element within the same module or assembly.                                 |
| static       | Indicates that a member belongs to the class itself rather than to a specific instance.           |
| final        | or sealed: Prevents inheritance or extension of classes or methods.                               |
| abstract     | Marks a class as incomplete and cannot be instantiated on its own.                                |
| virtual      | Marks a method that can be overridden by subclasses.                                              |
| override     | Indicates that a method is intended to override a method in a base class.                         |
| const        | Declares a constant value that cannot be modified.                                                |
| readonly     | Marks a field that can only be assigned a value at the time of declaration or in the constructor. |
| volatile     | Indicates that a variable may be modified by multiple threads.                                    |
| async        | Marks a method as asynchronous.                                                                   |
| await        | Used within asynchronous methods to pause execution until an awaited task completes.              |
| throws       | or throwsException: Specifies exceptions that a method may throw.                                 |
| synchronized | Ensures that only one thread can access a synchronized method or block at a time.                 |
| native       | Indicates that a method is implemented in a different language or platform.                       |
| transient    | In object serialization, indicates that a field should not be serialized.                         |
| volatile     | In some languages, indicates that a variable may be modified by multiple threads.                 |
| deprecated   | Marks an element as deprecated, usually with a message indicating its replacement.                |
