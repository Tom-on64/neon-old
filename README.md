# Neon Lang
---

## About
Neon is a Fast, All-purpose, Multiparadigm, Compiled programming language. 
Neon works by compiling into Neon Executables (.nex), which can be ran by the Neon runner on any machine.

## Current state
You can check on the current grammar [here](syntax/grammar.syn) (I'll try to keep updating it) \
Currently outputs nasm assembly \
Also uses mac syscalls so you'll need to change the in [stdlib.json](src/stdlib.json)

### Check out the [TODO List](TODO.md)
### You can see the [Change Log](CHANGELOG.md)

## VSCode Extension
I made an extension for VSCode to add Neon support \
Here's the [Repository](https://github.com/Tom-on64/neon-syntax)
